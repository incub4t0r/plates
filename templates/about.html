    <h3><strong>What is plates?</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        I built this mobile-first web application to help calculate the plates I needed load for workouts.
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>What can I do with plates?</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        You can enter in the weight you want to use, then assuming you are using a 45lb bar, the page will load the plates you need to load per side.
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>What is plates built on?</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        plates is built on html, css, and flask. Currently plates is running on pythonanywhere.com.
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>I can do this in my head.</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        This web app is a small portion of a larger project I am working on to track your maxes and compete against your friends on a leaderboard, which may or may never be released. Stay tuned!
    </ul>   

    <h3><strong>Your calculator doesn't work.</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        I am tracking an issue with 2.5 increments on weights, and that is a side effect of the math.floor function I am using. I plan to fix this soon.
    </ul>
